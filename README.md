# Airlines Management System
The Airlines Management System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to streamline and automate the management of an airline's core operations. The system integrates features for managing flights, passengers, bookings, employee details, routes, fares, and transactions. Built using Streamlit for its user interface and SQLite for its database, this project provides a scalable and intuitive solution for airline administrators and end-users alike.

The application incorporates dynamic logging, enabling audit trails for key operations such as flight scheduling, passenger management, and fare updates. Additionally, it leverages triggers within the database to automate log generation for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations, enhancing operational transparency and accountability.

## Features

### Flight Management
Efficiently manage flight schedules, departure/arrival timings, and associated aircraft. Keep track of all active and historical flights with detailed logging for every update.

### Passenger Management
Maintain comprehensive records of passenger details, including their contact information, nationality, and booking history. Quickly retrieve passenger information to enhance customer service.

### Dynamic Booking System
Facilitate secure and seamless ticket bookings by linking passengers, flights, and transactions. Automatically calculate fares, apply discounts, or add charges based on business rules.

### Real-time Logs and Monitoring
Automatically log all database operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) for critical tables such as flights, passengers, and transactions. Enable advanced search capabilities to audit or troubleshoot activities.

### Search and Filtering
Search for records like passengers, flights, and logs using flexible filtering options. Simplify record retrieval with advanced search based on parameters like flight ID, date, passenger name, and routes.

### Aircraft Management
Maintain an inventory of aircraft with details like capacity, manufacturer, and manufacturing date. Automatically generate unique aircraft numbers for new entries.

### Route and Fare Management
Define and update routes between airports and their corresponding fares. Manage base fares, fuel surcharges, and dynamic pricing adjustments based on real-time requirements.

### Employee and Branch Management
Store and manage employee details, including branch locations, contact information, and job roles. Allow for role-based access to manage operational workflows efficiently.

### Scalable Design
Built with scalability in mind, the system can accommodate new requirements like additional features or growing passenger data without disrupting operations.
